=============

<h3>This version edited by lazyink for Chernarus. It <i>should</i> work. Good luck.</h3>
<h4>You may need to customize the weapons loadouts for the NPC's and fillBoxes.sqf -- Also, you may need to change which vehicles spawn for major missions SM4, SM5, and SM6</h4>

<b>In your server.pbo:</b>

Add to server_functions.sqf place compile near beginning and if (isServer) near end:

    fnc_hTime = compile preprocessFile "\z\addons\dayz_server\Missions\misc\fnc_hTime.sqf"; //Random integer selector for mission wait time
    if (isServer) then { 
      SMarray = ["SM1","SM2","SM3","SM4","SM5","SM6","SM7"];
        [] execVM "\z\addons\dayz_server\missions\Major\SMfinder.sqf"; //Starts major mission system
    	SMarray2 = ["SM1","SM2","SM3","SM4","SM5","SM6","SM7"];
    	[] execVM "\z\addons\dayz_server\missions\Minor\SMfinder.sqf"; //Starts minor mission system
    };

Add to server_updateObject.sqf place right after terms defined:

    if (_object getVariable "Mission" == 1) exitWith {};


Change line in server_cleanup.fsm around line 349 in the Check for Hacker section:

    if(vehicle _x != _x && (vehicle _x getVariable [""Mission"",0] != 1) && !(vehicle _x in _safety) && (typeOf vehicle _x) != ""ParachuteWest"") then {" \n

IF YOU HAVE SARGE AI INSTALLED YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE VEHICLE VARIABLE IN EACH MISSION TO "SARGE" INSTEAD OF USING "MISSIONS" (Not tested with SARGE AI, may be incompatible.)


<b>In your mission.pbo:</b>

Download http://all.quixoticfolly.com/hillbilly.ogg and place it in the root of your mission.pbo

This isn't working yet. If you figure it out, let me know. admin@quixoticfolly.com

In your description.ext paste this at end:

    class CfgSounds
    {
      sounds[] = {};
      
        class hillbilly
      {
        name="hillbilly";
        sound[]={hillbilly.ogg,0.9,1};
        titles[] = {};
      };
    };

The AI require faction settings. If you have SARGE AI you're good to go. Otherwise add faction.sqf to your mission.pbo and add this line to your init.sqf:

    [] execVM "faction.sqf";

If your map does not have a marker named "Center" in the middle of map you must add one to the mission.sqm in the mission.pbo

        class Markers
    	{
    		items=7;
    		class Item0
    		{
    			position[]={5406.9092,30.012478,8796.7354};
    			name="center";
    			type="Empty";
      	  };


<b>Other stuff:</b>

In the Missions\Minor\SM3.sqf you must specify your own coords for the NPC's/PBX to spawn and the landing point on beach. Coords used are for Namalsk only.

In the createvehicle.txt comment out the SMAW lines and the Mine lines.
